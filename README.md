bus flet management system

Abstract 

This project, Bus Fleet Management System, is a simple console-based application developed in the C programming language. The goal of the system is to store and display essential information about buses in a transportation fleet. The program uses a user-defined structure (struct Bus) to hold details such as the bus number, driver name, source location, and destination. Multiple records are stored using an array of structures.

The user is first prompted to enter the number of buses, after which the program collects details for each bus through standard input. Once the data entry is complete, the system displays all stored bus details in a clean, readable format. This project demonstrates fundamental C concepts such as structure declaration, array handling, formatted input/output functions, and iterative processing.

The system is simple, memory-efficient, and useful for beginners learning how to manage grouped data in C. Although basic, it can be extended to include features such as searching, sorting, file handling, or dynamic memory allocation. Overall, this project provides a foundational understanding of data organization and struct usage in C programming.
